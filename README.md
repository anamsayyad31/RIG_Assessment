# RIG_Assessment

This project demonstrates the integration of **React.js** (Frontend) and **FastAPI** (Backend) for creating a user profile form, which captures user information and displays it on a second page. It consists of two main components:

1. **Frontend (React.js)**: A React application that takes user input for a profile form.
2. **Backend (FastAPI)**: A FastAPI server that serves the frontend and handles any necessary backend operations.

## Features

- User can enter basic information like Name, Email, Date of Birth, and Phone number.
- The form includes validation for mandatory fields.
- After form submission, the entered data is displayed on a second page.

## Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you need the following tools:

- Node.js (for React frontend)
- Python (for FastAPI backend)
- Git
- VSCode or another code editor of your choice
